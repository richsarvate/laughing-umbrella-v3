# Stock Trading Transformer# üß† Position-Agnostic Stock Trading Transformer# üß† Position-Agnostic Stock Trading Transformer



A transformer that learns market patterns without cheating.



## The Problem**A transformer that learns pure market patterns without position bias****A transformer that learns pure market patterns without position bias**

Most trading models cheat by memorizing:

- "Apple is always first in the data"

- "Position 50 always has Tesla" 

- Company names and ticker symbols## üéØ How Training Works## üéØ How Training Works



## Our Solution

**Position Shuffling**: Randomly shuffle stock order every batch

**Anonymous Data**: Only use technical patterns (momentum, volatility, RSI)### 1. **Position Shuffling**### 1. **Position Shuffling**



## ResultsThe model never sees stocks in the same order twice:The model never sees stocks in the same order twice:

```

Trained on 2014-2024 data (308 stocks)- Each training batch randomly shuffles all stock positions- Each training batch randomly shuffles all stock positions

Epoch 0:   -0.35% returns

Epoch 140: +0.61% returns- Prevents learning "Apple is always first" or "Tesla is position 50"- Prevents learning "Apple is always first" or "Tesla is position 50"

```

- Forces the model to focus on technical patterns, not arrangement- Forces the model to focus on technical patterns, not arrangement

## Usage

```bash

python train_model_2014_2024.py

The model learns genuine market patterns, not data quirks.No ticker symbols reach the model:No ticker symbols reach the model:

- Only technical indicators: momentum, volatility, RSI  - Only technical indicators: momentum, volatility, RSI  

- Stocks become `STOCK_000`, `STOCK_001`, etc. internally- Stocks become `STOCK_000`, `STOCK_001`, etc. internally
